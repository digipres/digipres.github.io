			<p>DWG is the proprietary native file format for AutoCAD, one of the most popular computer-assisted design (CAD) packages.  The format is maintained by <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/">AutoDesk</a>.  DWG is a compact binary format that stores and describes the content of 2D and 3D design data and metadata.  AutoCAD 1.0 was released in 1982, but the origins of the DWG format are from the late 1970s, when it was the native format for a CAD package called Interact.  The format has been updated frequently as the AutoCAD product has been enhanced.</p>
			<p>As of January 2020, PRONOM had records for 19 chronological versions, none of which is publicly documented by AutoDesk.  One more recent version, associated with AutoCAD 2018 through 2020, is in use.  Autodesk lists recent versions of DWG at <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/search-result/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2018/ENU/AutoCAD-Customization/files/GUID-D029509F-A2A0-4A7E-BDD5-FE95E7235C5C-htm.html">About Drawing File Format Changes</a> and a fuller list at <a href="https://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/autocad-release-history.html">AutoCAD Release History</a>.  The compilers of this resource have chosen to describe the DWG family of formats in a single document.  See <a href="#notes">Notes</a> below, for information about the chronological versions of the AutoCAD application and associated versions of the DWG format.</p>
			<p>The syntactic structure of a DWG drawing file includes sections and section substructures.  The primary substance of a drawing is in a section with name AcDb:AcDbObjects.   This contains component graphical elements (known as entities) and other objects that support the editing and rendering of drawings.  Internal connections in the drawing file use identifiers for objects (including the graphical entities) known as &quot;handles.&quot;  Objects declare their own handles and may refer to other objects via handle references.  Handle references may indicate ownership or simply be pointers to other structures.  See <a href="#notes">Notes</a> below for more on handles in DWG files. Cyclic redundancy checksums (CRC) are used extensively for error detection.</p>
			<p>A typical DWG file will include at least the following sections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Header:</b>  This section always comes first in the DWG file.  The first &quot;variable&quot; in the header is the code used to identify the DWG format version (see <a href="#sign">File type signifiers</a> below).  Other header variables include: default units and styles for the drawing; drawing size limits; coordinate systems to use for spatial positioning; a project name; creation and modification dates and times, etc.  The header also includes information needed to read and write the particular file: references to locations in the file where other sections begin; section lengths; flags to indicate how much of the file content is encrypted; and a stream of handle references to other structures.  A DWG file may contain structures that are no longer used; hence the best way to interpret a file is to start from the header and trace references from there until all references have been followed.  A duplicate of the header section is stored near the end of the DWG file.</li>
				<li>
					<b>Classes:</b> Holds information relating to application-defined or custom classes whose instances (objects) appear in other sections.</li>
				<li>
					<b>Object Data:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Entities (graphical objects):</b> These include simple graphical entity types such as LINE, CIRCLE, VERTEX and more complex types such as SHAPE, POLYLINE, 3DFACE, 3DSOLID, SPLINE, etc.  Entity objects can include handle references for related objects, including child (&quot;owned&quot;) objects and parent (&quot;owner&quot;) objects.</li>
						<li>
							<b>Non-graphical objects:</b> These include dictionaries, settings, etc. that support the drawing and rendering functions in a CAD application.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Object Map (Handles):</b> A table which gives the location of each object in the file, listing all handle identifiers and the corresponding location in the file by an offset into the into the AcDb:AcDbObjects section.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>See <a href="#notes">Notes</a> below for more sections and object types that might occur in DWG files.</p>

		<fdd:preference>Among vector graphics formats, the Library of Congress has expressed a preference for the AutoCAD Drawing Interchange Format (<fddLink id="fdd000446">DXF</fddLink>).  Widely used proprietary formats are acceptable if needed to be a faithful representation of a work.  See <a href="http://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/stillimg.html">Recommended Formats Statement: Still Image Works</a>.  The U.S. Copyright Office accepts DWG and DWF formats for registration of architectural drawings.

			<p>The DWG format is a proprietary format developed and maintained by AutoDesk.  No specification has been published by AutoDesk.</p>
		</fdd:disclosure>
		<fdd:documentation>
			<p>The conceptual and semantic aspects of the DWG drawing format are covered best in the documentation AutoDesk supplies for the <fddLink id="fdd000446">DXF Drawing Interchange Format</fddLink> in its help system [<a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/OARX/2020/ENU/?guid=GUID-235B22E0-A567-4CF6-92D3-38A2306D73F3">About the DXF Format | AutoCAD 2020</a>].</p>
			<p>The closest thing to a specification for the syntax of DWG files is the <a href="https://www.opendesign.com/files/guestdownloads/OpenDesign_Specification_for_.dwg_files.pdf">Open Design Specification for .dwg files</a>, derived by the Open Design Alliance (ODA) by reverse engineering.  As of January 2020, this document covers the DWG format from AutoCAD Release 13 through AutoCAD 2018 (AC1032).  The AC1032 version of DWG has been used from AutoCAD 2018 through AutoCAD 2020.</p>
			<p>The ODA  is a non-profit technology consortium of 1200 member companies that support the development of tools and SDKs to allow members to read and write files in DWG and other formats.  Membership is offered at a number of <a href="https://www.opendesign.com/pricing">pricing</a> levels, from a free educational option for qualified university programs through corporate memberships starting at $30,000 per year.  All memberships allow use of the ODA&apos;s .dwg toolset.</p>

			<p>The DWG format is very widely used.  It is the native format for AutoCAD and other AutoDesk products.  According to <a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/stories/autocad-takes-top-spot-in-2015-report-on-cad-products">an AutoDesk blog post</a>, AutoCAD scored top marks in a Winter 2015 rating for General-Purpose CAD.  <a href="https://chasmtech.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/is-bricscad-a-real-alternative-to-autocad/">Is BricsCAD A Real Alternative to AutoCAD?</a>, a blog post from April 28, 2015, indicates, &quot;Products competitive to AutoCAD have come and gone over the years. None appear to have the critical functionality and the supporting infrastructure to cause established AutoCAD users to risk the switch.&quot;  The post goes on to suggest that 100% DWG compatibility is the most important factor in considering alternative products.  CAD applications that use DWG as the native format include: products based on the <a href="https://www.intellicad.org/cad-development-platform-framework">IntelliCAD Technology Consortium</a> platform, such as <a href="https://www.intellicadms.com/">CMS Intellicad</a>; products based on the <a href="https://www.opendesign.com/solutions#dwg-toolset">DWG toolset</a> (formerly using the name Teigha) from the Open Design Alliance, such as <a href="https://www.caddiesoftware.com/index.php/company">Caddie</a>, <a href="https://www.bricsys.com/en-intl/">Bricsys products</a>, and <a href="https://www.opendesign.com/member-showcase/nanosoft">NanoCAD</a>; and <a href="https://www.cadkon.eu/en/01-02.html">CADKON+</a>.

ODA&apos;s <a href="https://www.opendesign.com/products/drawings">Drawings SDK</a> is based on software libraries formerly known as OpenDWG, DWGdirect, and <a href="https://www.opendesign.com/blog/2018/september/oda-announces-new-branding">Teigha</a>.  ODA <a href="https://www.opendesign.com/about">states</a> that it is committed to ensuring long-term access to critical CAD data and lists DWG among <a href="https://www.opendesign.com/about/formats">Formats Supported by ODA’s 100-Year Commitment</a>.   The IntelliCAD Technology Consortium (ITC) is a member of ODA (see <a href="https://www.opendesign.com/member-showcase/intellicad">Member Story: IntelliCAD Technology Consortium</a>) and source code for the core IntelliCAD software is available to commercial members of ITC.  The code used to read and write DWG files is presumably the same for both consortia. <a href="../contact_format.shtml">Comments welcome</a>.</p>
			<p>Open-source projects that aim to read and write DWG files include: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libredwg/">GNU LibreDWG</a> (a C library to handle DWG files), <a href="http://librecad.org/cms/home.html">LibreCAD</a> (an open-source 2D CAD application), and <a href="https://qcad.org/en/documentation/features">QCAD</a>. However, it appears that developing and supporting CAD applications may demand more effort and expertise than free open-source projects can maintain over the long term. In February 2016, a <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libredwg/2016-02/msg00000.html">message</a> in a discussion thread in the libredwg mail list with subject &quot;Looking for new maintainers&quot; includes the paragraph from one of the project leaders, &quot;Maybe it is a good time to discuss the future of this project. LibreCAD have implemented libdxfrw with DXF-rw (obviously) and DWG-r, apparently at a better stage than LibreDWG. Licenses were incompatible so they just hacked it themselves.&quot; A new maintainer for LibreDWG did emerge and development has continued.   Meanwhile, in May 2016, the <a href="http://blog.librecad.org/2016/05/valuable-asset-leaving-our-librecad-team/">LibreCAD blog</a> announced the departure from the team of "a very valuable asset." <a href="https://www.scivision.dev/overview-of-free-2d-cad-options-for-linux/">Free Libre 2-D CAD overview</a> offers a brief comparison in January 2020 of LibreCAD and QCAD.  Another indication of the difficulty of supporting open source efforts or products that are distributed free, is that in 2019, it was announced that <a href="https://www.draftsight.com/">DraftSight</a>, for which a single-user license had been available at no cost from 2010-2019 for Windows, MacOS and Linux, would no longer be available free or supported on platforms other than Windows.  See <a href="https://www.scivision.dev/draftsight-cad-software-on-ubuntu/">January 2020 blog post from a user of DraftSight on Linux</a>.</p>

				<b>Additional sections and object types:</b> Additional features that may be present in DWG files include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>SummaryInfo:</b> This optional section contains metadata.  Pre-defined properties include Title, Subject, Author, Keywords, Creation date/time, Modification date/time. The section can also contain other properties, represented as key/value pairs.  Other metadata sections include RevisionHistory, AppInfo (about the creating application), and Preview (a BMP or WMF thumbnail image to represent the DWG file in directory displays).</li>
				<li>
					<b>Blocks:</b> In AutoCAD, a &quot;block&quot; is a collection of objects that are combined into a single named object. Blocks are often created as independent drawing files and then inserted; libraries of blocks are made available by part suppliers.  Named blocks may not be recognized by all CAD software, even if the component objects are.</li>
				<li>
					<b>Layers:</b> In AutoCAD, layers provide a mechanism for organizing objects in a drawing by function or purpose. Layers can be turned on and off to reduce the visual complexity of a drawing and improve display performance. For example, a building plan might have layers for doors and for electrical wiring.</li>
				<li>
					<b>Image data:</b> Raster images can be stored in a DWG file along with clipping boundaries to use when embedded in the drawing.</li>

					<b>Data storage:</b>  This section (aka AcDsPrototype_1b) was introduced for AutoCAD 2013.  Standard ACIS Binary (SAB) and Standard ACIS Text (SAT) data for REGIONs and 3DSOLIDs are stored in this section.  In other contexts these bytestreams may be independent files with extensions .sab and .sat.  ACIS is a solid modelling geometric engine incorporated into many CAD packages.  See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACIS">Wikipedia entry for ACIS</a>.  This feature may also be used to store arbitrary &quot;blobs&quot; (binary large objects) in a DWG file.  According to articles from Design Engineering in <a href="http://www.design-engineering.com/features/bricsys-wants-3d-modeler/">March 18, 2016</a> and <a href="http://www.design-engineering.com/evolving-dwg-1004025431-1004025431/">December 13, 2016</a>, BricsCAD from Bricsys packs all its data (including other 3D data and BIM data) into its DWG files. A more technical blog post by the same author, Ralph Grabowski, <a href="http://www.upfrontezine.com/2017/01/betting-on-dwg-for-an-entire-ecosystem.html">Betting on DWG for an Entire Ecosystem</a>, describes the Bricsys approach in more detail, making it clear that it involves use not only of extensibility in the DWG format but also the use of extensions to the AutoDesk APIs.  A 2012 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160314042921/https://www.opendesign.com/member-showcase/2012/december/bricsys">Member showcase featuring Bricsys</a> from the Open Design Alliance indicates that Bricsys used ODA&apos;s TEIGHA libraries (now rebranded as <a href="https://www.opendesign.com/solutions#dwg-toolset">.dwg toolset</a>) and contributed enhancements and bug fixes back to ODA. <a href="https://www.graebert.com/en/arescommander">ARES</a> CAD software from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160313220425/https://www.opendesign.com/Member-Showcase/Graebert">Graebert</a> is also DWG-based, also using the ODA toolkits, and presumably takes advantage of this feature which introduces the potential for interoperability problems when software other than the application that created the DWG file is used to read or render it.  <a href="../contact_format.shtml">Comments welcome</a>.</li>

			<p>
				<b>Error detection and correction:</b>  The DWG format makes extensive use of Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC) to support error detection.  The version with code AC1021 (introduced in AutoCAD 2007) also used Reed-Solomon encoding to support error correction.  However, this mechanism was dropped in subsequent versions.</p>
			<p>
				<b>Handles in DWG files:</b> Objects in DWG files are referred to by object &quot;handles.&quot;  The syntax for these handle references comprises: a 4-bit code for handle type; a 4-bit counter for the length in bytes of the handle; followed by the handle itself.  The type codes distinguish between references that indicate an object directly and those that are expressed as an offset to another handle. The type codes for direct references divide handles into four categories:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>Soft ownership</i> reference: the owner does not need the owned object. The owned object cannot exist by itself.</li>
				<li>
					<i>Hard ownership</i> reference: the owner needs the owned object. The owned object cannot exist by itself.</li>
				<li>
					<i>Soft pointer</i> reference: the referencing object does not need the referenced object and vice versa.</li>
				<li>
					<i>Hard pointer</i> reference: the referencing object needs the referenced object, but both are owned by another object.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note: This use of the term &quot;handle&quot; is not related to the <a href="https://www.handle.net/">Handle System</a>, introduced in 1995 to manage persistent identifiers for digital objects.</p>
			<p>
				<b>3D objects in DWG files</b>:  AutoCAD was originally focused on a digital equivalent of drawings on paper but has steadily added 3D modeling features.  For example, a blog post from AutoDesk on <a href="http://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/2009/02/autocad-2010-and-3d.html">AutoCAD 2010 and 3D</a> highlights new features.  The post discusses AutoCAD 2010 features that support two technical forms of 3D representation: meshes and solids.  Both types of 3D model can be stored in a DWG file (starting at least from AC1024): Polymesh objects (also referred to as polyface meshes) are constructed from POLYLINE objects, which connect vertices; 3DSOLID and BODY objects hold 3D content in a form that allows solids to be hollowed out or surfaces to have thickness. The <a href="https://dxfgrabber.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation for dxfgrabber</a> indicates that the content of 3DSOLID and BODY have typically been ACIS solid models in SAT (Standard ACIS Text) form, but that since AutoCAD 2013 (AC1027), AutoCAD has stored ACIS data as SAB (Standard ACIS binary).  The AutoDesk documentation does not mention ACIS by name, but indicates that the content of <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/ACD/2017/ENU/?guid=GUID-19AB1C40-0BE0-4F32-BCAB-04B37044A0D3">3DSOLID</a> is of type &quot;AcDbModelerGeometry&quot; with modeler format version (currently 1) and a number of lines of proprietary data.  Judging from the DXF documentation available online, the 3DSOLID object was introduced with Release 13 of AutoCAD around 1995. Version 5.4.1 of the reverse-engineered Open Design Specification for DWG described these ACIS 3D objects in clause 20.4.41 and chapter 24, indicating that embedded SAB data is preceded by &quot;ACIS BinaryFile&quot; in ASCII and followed by &quot;End\x0E\x02of\x0E\x04ACIS\x0D\x04data&quot;.</p>
			<p>
				<b>Relationship of DXF and DWG:</b>  AutoCAD&apos;s Save Drawing As command offers the option of DWG and DXF formats.  The usual DXF file is a transparent ASCII text file, often recommended for interchange and preservation for this reason.  See <fddLink id="fdd000446">DXF_ASCII</fddLink>.  An equivalent binary DXF format is also defined; it is almost always described as &quot;DXF Binary&quot; or &quot;Binary DXF&quot;. DXF_Binary is not described separately on this website.</p>
			<p>According to <a href="http://www.scan2cad.com/dxf/slideshow-dxf-vs-dwg/#whatisdxf">a slideshow comparison of DWG and DXF from Scan2CAD</a>, &quot;The DXF file format was created at the same time as DWG (1982) and by the same company – Autodesk.  The DXF file format was developed to provide an exact representation of the data in the AutoCAD’s native file format, DWG.&quot;  However, AutoCAD has added and enhanced many features, some of which include embedding data not easily incorporated into a text file.  For example, the current DWG format includes the ability to embed Standard ACIS Binary (SAB) data and arbitrary blobs in the AcDsPrototype_1b section.  In <a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/OARX/2020/ENU/?guid=GUID-99626F3A-2EAE-42DA-9AC3-009D9E319AD6">Support Both DWG and DXF Storage Formats</a>, Autodesk states, &quot;Autodesk is committed to supporting both DWG and DXF storage formats as logically equivalent in content. DWG is a proprietary binary format that offers superior I/O performance, while DXF is a published format intended to both minimize application parsing requirements and maximize compatibility with previously released products.&quot;  The compilers of this resource have not been able to determine the degree to which the <i>full</i> semantic and functional content of <i>all</i> DWG files can be represented in DXF_ASCII files saved as DXF within all versions of AutoCAD.  <a href="../contact_format.shtml">Comments welcome</a>, particularly to identify content that may be held in a DWG file but would be either omitted or significantly changed when a DXF_ASCII file is written out.</p>
			<p>Statements about potential differences between the content of a DWG drawing and a corresponding DXF representation include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <a href="http://www.scan2cad.com/dxf/slideshow-dxf-vs-dwg/#whatisdxf">slideshow from Scan2CAD</a> cited above says, &quot;DWG and DXF stores different types of drawing information.&quot;  It states that &quot;DWG handles 3D geometry vs. DXF stores 2D vector images.&quot; and gives examples of information that DXF cannot handle, including &quot;photos.&quot;</li>
				<li>However, <a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/OARX/2020/ENU/?guid=GUID-7D07C886-FD1D-4A0C-A7AB-B4D21F18E484">About the DXF ENTITIES Section</a> in the DXF documentation clearly supports some 3D entities, including 3DFACE, and 3DSOLID.</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit-products/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/Revit-DocumentPresent/files/GUID-CE5C1481-40BE-4503-A55C-25B0BC0F817B-htm.html">Help on Solids for DWG/DXF Export from the AutoDesk REVIT product</a> suggests that either DWG or DXF can contain data for ACIS solids.</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://www.opencascade.com/content/dxf-import-export">Documentation for OpenCascade</a> makes it clear that DXF files can contain ACIS solid data in SAT (Standard ACIS Text) form.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Conversion of DWG to DXF using tools that are not based on the <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/realdwg">RealDWG SDK</a> used within AutoCAD may have different shortcomings. <a href="../contact_format.shtml">Comments welcome</a>.</p>
			<p>A separate issue is numerical precision. Conversion of numeric values represented in floating-point binary to ASCII characters always has the potential for loss of accuracy.  This is mentioned in the DXF documentation from AutoDesk by the statement, &quot;Unlike ASCII DXF files, which entail a trade-off between size and floating-point
accuracy, binary DXF files preserve the accuracy in the drawing database.&quot;  However, in many circumstances the difference will not be significant, as indicated in the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/ACD/2020/ENU/?guid=GUID-0FC24222-2C6A-4068-8ECF-DB7DDCEE6656">help for options for the AutoCad Save As DXF command</a>, &quot;The default precision is usually adequate; however, you might need to increase this value for certain drawings or applications.&quot;</p>
			<p>
				<b>Related publishing formats from AutoDesk:</b> Two proprietary formats with limited functionality have been developed by AutoDesk for publishing designs.  DWF and DWFx are secure file formats developed to combine and publish rich 2D- and 3D-design data.  They are highly compressed file formats suitable for distributing a single drawing or multiple drawings and sheet sets over the Internet for review by people without a CAD application.  AutoDesk provides a free application, Autodesk Design Review, for this purpose.  DWFx is a relatively new version of the DWF file format, based on Microsoft&apos;s XML Paper Specification (XPS).  DWFx documents can be viewed and printed with the Microsoft XPS Viewer, distributed as part of the Windows operating system.  See <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/files/GUID-DFC086F4-E98C-4FF7-A55E-67FC35007DE5-htm.html">About DWF and DWFx Files</a>.</p>

		<fdd:history>
			<p>The precursor to AutoCAD was Interact, written by Mike Riddle for early microcomputers, starting in 1977, and released as a product in 1979 for a system based on a Marinchip 9900 CPU, which had hardware multiplication.  In 1981, Riddle and the principals of Marinchip Systems, John Walker and Dan Drake, joined about a dozen other people to found AutoDesk and rewrite the software for the IBM PC.  See <a href="http://www.retrothing.com/2007/05/mike_riddles_pr.html">Mike Riddle&apos;s Prehistoric AutoCAD</a>; <a href="http://www.digibarn.com/stories/mike-riddle/index.html">interviews in 2005 with Mike Riddle</a> from the Digibarn Computer Museum; and <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/">The Autodesk File: Bits of History, Words of Experience</a> by John Walker.  The highly compressed form of the DWG format has its origins in the early days of personal computers.</p>
			<p>AutoDesk released AutoCad 1.0 in December 1982. A chronology of AutoCAD software releases is at <a href="http://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/autocad-release-history.html">AutoCAD Release History</a>; a section on DWG File History lists version codes for the DWG format.  See <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-find-which-version-of-AutoCAD-was-used-to-create-save-a-DWG.html">How to find the format of a DWG or which version of AutoCAD was used to create/save a DWG</a> for an explanation of how DWG version codes and AutoCAD release identifiers are stored in DWG files in the initial bytes in the file (readable as ASCII or Hex characters even though the file content is mainly in a compact binary form).  New DWG versions have been introduced roughly every two or three years since 1990. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dwg">Wikipedia article for the DWG format</a> also lists version codes back through version 1.0.</p>

					<fdd:intro>DWG is a proprietary format with no official specification. A partial specification has been derived by the Open Design Alliance by reverse engineering. It focuses on the bit-level structure of the highly compressed and sometimes encrypted parts of the binary format. As of January 2020, this specification states that it covers the DWG file format from as used by AutoCAD release 13 (November 1994) up to and including version 2018 and has version number 5.4.1.  AutoDesk <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad-lt/learn-explore/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/AutoCAD-drawing-file-format.html">indicates</a> that AutoCAD 2020 still uses the same format version as AutoCAD 2018.</fdd:intro>

					<fdd:intro>The reverse-engineered specification for the DWG format (see immediately above) in many places says, &quot;See DXF documentation.&quot;  In addition, the DXF specification presents the conceptual and semantic structure of the format more clearly; the DWG &quot;specification&quot; focuses on the bit-level structure of the highly compressed and sometimes encrypted parts of the binary format.  The DXF format and specification document have been updated many times over the years.  Some of the document versions may be identical in substance.

					<fdd:intro>Resources about interoperability among CAD applications for DWG files. One source of interoperability issues is whether applications can handle new classes of 3D object, BIM/IFC data, or other new features. Although AutoDesk and ODA have both described how 3D ACIS solid models may be stored, other 3D data or BIM/IFC data may not be understood by applications other than those they were created by.</fdd:intro>
