				<a href="https://www.snia.org/">Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA)</a>, in the conference paper, <a href="https://research.ibm.com/haifa/conferences/_systor2011/present/session5_talk3_SIRF_SYSTORr4.pdf">Towards SIRF: Self- Contained Information Retention Format</a>, defines SIRF as a logical container format appropriate for long-term storage of digital information. It is described as the digital equivalent of collecting a group of related items, placing them into a physical box, and labeling the box with information  about the contents.</p>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.snia.org/about">SNIA</a> is a global, non-profit organization that is the &quot;recognized and trusted authority for storage leadership, standards, and technology expertise worldwide.&quot; SIRF was developed by the SNIA Long Term Retention (LTR) Technical Working Group (TWG). The <a href="https://www.snia.org/tech_activities/standards/curr_standards/sirf">SNIA website</a> states, &quot;The SIRF format enables long-term physical storage, cloud storage and tape-based containers effective and efficient ways to preserve and secure digital information for many decades, even with the ever-changing technology landscape.&quot;</p>
			<p>SNIA Technical Position specifies SIRF Level 1 &quot;and its serialization for <a href="https://www.snia.org/tech_activities/standards/curr_standards/ltfs">LTFS</a>, <a href="https://www.snia.org/cdmi">CDMI</a> and <a href="https://www.snia.org/educational-library/openstack-swift-file-user-identity-cross-protocol-access-demystified-2015">OpenStack Swift</a>.&quot; Users can find the <a href="https://www.snia.org/tech_activities/standards/curr_standards/sirf">SNIA SIRF Specification Version 1.0</a> on their website. SIRF components and use cases are defined in the SNIA document, <a href="https://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SIRF_Use_Cases_V05a_DRAFT.pdf">SIRF Use Cases and Functional Requirements, Working Draft</a>, published September 2010. The format is also documented as an <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</a> specification, <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/76648.html">ISO/IEC 23681</a>, published May 2019.</p>
			<p>
				<b>SIRF Description:</b>
			</p>
			<p>As describe in the SNIA document, <a href="https://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SIRF_Use_Cases_V05a_DRAFT.pdf">SIRF Use Cases and Functional Requirements</a>, moving complete digital content between systems and technologies in the future will be easier with a standard that has these key properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Self-contained - object data and its metadata are treated and moved together as a single storable unit; object's container should include metadata about interrelationship between the object(s) and the metadata about the object(s).</li>
				<li>Self-describing - interpret the data package correctly; determine container object(s) and their associated metadata.<ul>
						<li>"Self-describing formats remain useful if at the root of the recursion they use only very widely used formats, such as ASCII, and the self-description itself can be updated over time. While it is possible to create self-describing proprietary formats, widely used industry standard formats are more likely to have a long life."</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Extensible - allows for addition and extensions while preserving integrity of original data.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>SIRF is a "<a href="https://www.tibco.com/reference-center/what-is-a-logical-data-model">logical data format</a> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_(computing)">mountable</a> unit e.g., a filesystem, a block device, a stream device, an object store, a tape, etc. It assumes the mountable unit includes an object interface layer that constructs objects out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_sector">sectors and blocks</a>."</p>
			<p>
				<b>SIRF Container Components:</b>
			</p>
			<p>According to the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/76648.html">SIRF Standard</a>, SIRF has the following components:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Magic object:<ul>
						<li>The magic object identifies the container and its version.</li>
						<li>Independent of the media, it has an agreed defined name and a fixed size.</li>
						<li>Has means to access the SIRF catalog.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Preservation Objects (PO):<ul>
						<li>Contains the actual data to be preserved.</li>
						<li>May include multiple versions of objects and multiple copies of each version.</li>
						<li>
							<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/76648.html">SIRF Standard</a> does not specify POs format, generally created by the application/service outside the storage subsystem.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>A Catalog:<ul>
						<li>That is updatable and contains metadata for the container and its objects to be portable/accessible in future without relying on external metadata.</li>
						<li>&quot;The SIRF catalog is an object that includes metadata about the Preservation Objects (POs) in the container and their relationship. It has a well-defined standardized format so it can be understandable in the future.&quot;</li>
						<li>The catalog contains metadata for both the whole container and the preservation objects within the container. Both types are organized into categories. See Adoption for more information.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <a href="https://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SIRF_Use_Cases_V05a_DRAFT.pdf">SIRF Use Cases and Functional Requirements</a> states, "SIRF is scoped to define the metadata and format in its catalog, which includes information about the preservation objects, the relationship among these objects and information to support implementation of preservation processes."</p>
			<p>
				<b>SIRF Serialization:</b>
			</p>
			<p>The <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/76648.html">SIRF Standard</a> provides the conditions to be met for CDMI/LTFS/Swift containers to qualify as a SIRF container.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="https://www.snia.org/cdmi">Cloud Data Management Interface (CDMI)</a>:<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/83451.html">ISO/IEC 17826 Standard</a> - interoperable format for moving data and metadata between cloud providers, defines a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Data_Management_Interface">RESTful Interface</a> - data objects are accessed by standard browsers/internet tools.</li>
						<li>It has an open-source implementation on top of OpenStack Swift.</li>
						<li>Qualified SIRF container adds Extension specification defining the new field for cloud support.</li>
						<li>Serialization: SIRF magic object mapped to CDMI container metadata, SIRF catalog is an object in CDMI container, SIRF PO simple object mapped to CDMI data object, SIRF PO composite object mapped to set of data objects/manifest data object.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://www.snia.org/education/what-is-lfts">Linear Tape File System (LTFS)</a>:<ul>
						<li>Format Specification Defines LTFS Volumes - holds data files and metadata describing the directory and file structures stored on the volume.</li>
						<li>Files are written to and read from LTFS Volume using <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1003.1/1388/">POSIX</a> file operations.</li>
						<li>LTFS Volume includes XML index with metadata, such as file name, dates, extended attributes, etc.</li>
						<li>LTFS Volume is partitioned - Data Partition and Index Partition, each containing a label construct followed by content area.</li>
						<li>Serialization: SIRF magic object mapped to extended attributes "LTFS index" root directory, SIRF catalog is within index partition, PO mapped to LTFS file/set of files.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://www.snia.org/educational-library/openstack-swift-file-user-identity-cross-protocol-access-demystified-2015">OpenStack Swift</a>:<ul>
						<li>Object/blob store in the cloud.</li>
						<li>Uses a <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStackRESTAPI">RESTful interface</a> for creation, manipulation, and deletion of objects/metadata.</li>
						<li>Serialization: SIRF objects mapped to Swift objects, SIRF containers mapped to Swift containers, magic object is included in Swift container's metadata, catalog mapped to a file in container, PO mapped to Swift objects in container and referenced in catalog.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<b>Uses of SIRF Container Format:</b>
			</p>
			<p>As described in the conference paper, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221351953_Towards_SIRF_Self-contained_information_retention_format">Towards SIRF: Self-Contained Information Retention Format</a>, the Long Term Retention (LTR) working group created the SIRF standard format to be a "vendor-neutral storage format that will help its customers interpret preservation objects in the future, even by systems and applications that do not exist today. SIRF provides strong encapsulation of large quantities of metadata with the data at the storage level, and enables easy migration of the preserved data across storage devices...SIRF is agnostic to the type of storage medium as well as to any type of data."</p>
			<p>SIRF's self-describing and self-contained container makes it useful for offline storage media, as well as storage that remains online.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/76648.html">SIRF Standard</a> states, "A SIRF-compliant CDMI container, LTFS Tape or Swift container enables future CDMI/LTFS/Swift clients "understand" containers created by today's CDMI/LTFS/Swift clients although the properties of the future client is unknown to us today. By 'understand', it means that clients can identify the preservation objects in the container, the packaging format of each object, its fixity values, etc. (as defined in the SIRF catalog)."</p>
			<p>According to Stephen Pritchard in <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/">ComputerWeekly.com's</a> feature article, <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Indefinite-storage-What-it-is-and-why-you-might-need-it">Indefinite Storage: What It Is and Why You Might Need It</a>, November 2022, "The industry has developed common formats, such as PDF/A (which dates back to 2005) and self- declaratory data, such as the Self-Contained Information Retention Format, or SIRF. These data formats allow for software obsolescence. Chief information officers can exploit the fact that storing data for longer is becoming easier."</p>

				<p>SNIA's <a href="https://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SIRF_Use_Cases_V05a_DRAFT.pdf">SIRF Use Cases and Functional Requirements</a> describes the SIRF levels, stating "SIRF is defined using a layered approach with two levels. The SIRF level 1 catalog contains unique metadata that is not included within the preservation objects, but is mandatory to make those preservation objects portable into the future...The SIRF level 2 catalog includes information that may also be included within the preservation objects but is needed for fast access to the preservation objects."</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Level 1 Examples: Fixity algorithms, fixity values, fixity calculation dates, etc.</li>
					<li>Level 2 Examples: Referential integrity, metadata about packaging format, etc.</li>
				</ul>
