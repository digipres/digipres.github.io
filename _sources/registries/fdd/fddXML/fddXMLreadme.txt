fddXMLreadme.txt

This readme file is ZIP-packaged with the full set of XML versions of FDDs (Format Description Documents), downloadable from this location: http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fddXML.zip. 

The fddXML directory holds the individual XML versions of FDDs. These XML FDDs may accessed individually if the identifier is known, using the following path- and file-name pattern: http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fddXML/fddnnnnnn.xml. Here's an example.  The HTML version of the main PDF description is here: http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000030.shtml. The corresponding XML version is here: http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fddXML/fdd000030.xml.  

The format description documents comply with a primary XML Schema Definition (.xsd file), which refers to a subsidiary schema using an xsd:include declaration. The subsidiary schema handles HTML styling within the longer text fields in FDDs.

The HTML versions of the FDDs on the Library of Congress Web site carry this comment:  <!--This FDD was generated based on an XML master of the FDD schema and using an XSLT transformation.-->

Background note:  These digital format descriptions were compiled for the Web site "Sustainability of Digital Formats" (http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/), developed under the auspices of the Library of Congress National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP; http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/).
