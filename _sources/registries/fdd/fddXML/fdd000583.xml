			<p>EXR files are images saved in the OpenEXR (also known as EXR) raster image file format. As
stated on <a href="https://openexr.com/en/latest/index.html">OpenEXR.com</a>, "OpenEXR provides the specification (referenced throughout this
document) and reference implementation of the EXR file format, the professional-grade image
storage format of the motion picture industry. The purpose of EXR format is to accurately and
efficiently represent high-dynamic-range scene-linear image data and associated metadata, with
strong support for multi-part, multi-channel use cases."</p>
			<p>EXR was originally a proprietary format developed by <a href="https://www.ilm.com/">Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM)</a> in 1999
but became a project of the <a href="https://www.aswf.io/">Academy Software Foundation (ASWF)</a> in 2019. As stated by the
<a href="https://www.aswf.io/news/aswf-deep-dive-openexr-origin-story-part-1/">ASWF news article, ASWF Deep Dive: Open EXR Origin Story: Part 1</a>,"Released to the public
in 2003, it is one of the earliest open-source software projects specific to VFX and set the
industry on a new course." According to <a href="https://openexr.com/en/latest/about.html">OpenEXR.com</a>, "<a href="https://www.wetafx.co.nz/">Weta Digital</a>, <a href="https://disneyanimation.com/">Walt Disney Animation
Studios</a>, <a href="https://www.imageworks.com/">Sony Pictures Imageworks</a>, <a href="https://www.pixar.com/">Pixar Animation Studios</a>, <a href="https://www.dreamworks.com/">DreamWorks</a>, and other studios,
companies, and individuals have made contributions to the code base."</p>
			<p>
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenEXR">OpenEXR Wikipedia</a>, the "format has been updated several times, adding support for tiles,
mipmaps, new compression methods, and other features." OpenEXR Version 3.1.7, released
March 28, 2023, is the most current version released, see <a href="https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/blob/main/CHANGES.md">OpenEXR GitHub Release Notes</a> for
future releases and updates.</p>
			<p>
				<b>New Features in OpenEXR v3.1:</b>
			</p>
			<p>As described on <a href="https://openexr.com/en/latest/about.html">OpenEXR.com</a>, OpenEXR v3.1 introduces a new library, OpenEXRCore, "a
significant re-thinking of how OpenEXR manages file I/O and provides access to image
data...The 3.1 release of the OpenEXRCore library simply offers new functionality for specialty
applications seeking the highest possible performance...The 3.1 release represents a technology
preview for upcoming releases. The initial release is incremental; the existing API and 
underlying behavior has not changed."</p>

			<p>
				<b>OpenEXR File Structure:</b>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Header
					<ul>
						<li>List of attributes describing the pixels.</li>
						<li>For program versatility, certain attributes are required for all OpenEXR File
Headers, including: displayWindow, dataWindow, pixelAspectRatio, channels,
compression, lineOrder, screenWindowWidth, screenWindowCenter, and
tileDescription.</li>
						<li>multi-view OpenEXR files, multi-part and/or deep data OpenEXR files, all files
which contain deep data (deepscanline or deeptile) EACH have their own list of
attributes that are required. See <a href="https://openexr.com/en/latest/TechnicalIntroduction.html">OpenEXR Overview of the OpenEXR File Format
File Structure</a> for complete list of required attributes.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Pixels
					<ul>
						<li>A set of pixel data in particular format (scanlines, tiles, or deep data) or data type
is called a chunk, and the structure is defined by the type of pixel data stored in it.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<a href="https://openexr.com/en/latest/TechnicalIntroduction.html">OpenEXR.com</a> states "Every OpenEXR image contains one or more Image Channels. Each
channel has a name, a data type, and 'x' and 'y' sampling rates."</p>
			<p>Predefined Channel Names include, 'R,' 'G,' 'B,' and 'A' (alpha).</p>
			<p>Currently, OpenEXR supports three Data Types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>HALF - 16-bit floating-point numbers, for regular image data.</li>
				<li>FLOAT - 32-bit IEEE-754 floating point numbers, used when range/precision of 16-bit
is not sufficient.</li>
				<li>UINT - 32-bit unsigned integers, for discrete per-pixel data such as object identifiers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>OpenEXR Data Compression:</b>
			</p>
			<p>OpenEXR offers different data compression methods, having various speeds and tradeoffs.
<a href="https://openexr.com/en/latest/TechnicalIntroduction.html">OpenEXR.com</a> describes the different compression methods as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PIZ (lossless) - wavelet transform is applied, results are Huffman-encoded, works best for
scanline-based files.</li>
				<li>ZIPS (lossless) - operates one scan line at a time, uses open source zlib library for
compression.</li>
				<li>ZIP (lossless) - operates in blocks of 16 scan lines, uses open source zlib library for
compression, decompression is faster than compression. "Multi-resolution files are often
used as texture maps for 3D renderers. For this application, fast read access is usually
more important than fast writes, or maximum compression."</li>
				<li>RLE (lossless) - a fast method that works well for images with large flat areas.</li>
				<li>PXR24 (lossy) - reduces 32-bit floating point data to 24 bits by rounding, works well for
depth buffers and similar images where range values are very large but full 32-bit is not
necessary, not supported in deep files.</li>
				<li>B44 (lossy) - HALF channels are split to reduce data to 44 percent uncompressed size,
UINT or FLOAT channels are not compressed, advantageous for systems that support
real-time playback of image sequences, not supported in deep files.</li>
				<li>B44A (lossy) - similar to B44, blocks of same value pixels are packed into 3 bytes, used
for large uniform areas, not supported in deep files.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenEXR">OpenEXR Wikipedia</a> other compression options, listed below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>DWAA (JPEG-like lossy) - compresses pixels in blocks of 32 scanlines.</li>
				<li>DWAB (JPEG-like lossy) - compresses pixels in blocks of 256 scanlines.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="https://rendertoken.com/">RenderToken.com's</a> user guide article, <a href="https://know.rendertoken.com/getting-started/how-to-get-started/recommended-dwa-compression">Linear EXR Workflows and
Recommended DWA Compression</a>, states "Bundling more lines together lets
DWAB compress more efficiently and increases performance when the entire
image is read at once, as most programs do. Meanwhile, DWAA&#39;s smaller bundles
make it more efficient for reading just a few scanlines at a time."</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>Using OpenEXR:</b>
			</p>
			<p>OpenEXR.com states, "OpenEXR is widely used in host application software where accuracy is
critical, such as photorealistic rendering, texture access, image compositing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_image_compositing">deep composition</a>,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_intermediate">DI</a>."</p>

		<fdd:history>
			<p>OpenEXR was originally a proprietary format developed by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) in 1999 and released to the public in 2003. As stated on DigitalCinemaColorist.com' blog, <a href="https://digitalcinemacolorist.com/color-news/2015/6/17/demystify-openexr-aces">Demystify - OpenEXR &amp; Aces</a>, June 2015, "ILM developed the OpenEXR format in response to the demand for higher color accuracy and control in effects. OpenEXR is an open format, not tied to any one manufacturer or company and it is remarkable in several ways...The first movies to employ OpenEXR were Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Men in Black II, Gangs of New York, and Signs."</p>
			<p>OpenEXR became an Academy Software Foundation (ASWF) project in 2019, where <a href="https://www.aswf.io/news/aswf-deep-dive-openexr-origin-story-part-3/">OpenEXR's Technical Steering Committee (TSC)</a> is "dedicated to maintaining OpenEXR as an open standard image format for entertainment content creation."</p>
