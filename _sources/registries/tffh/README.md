TFFH: File extensions from The File Formats Handbook (Günter Born)
==================================================================

[The File Formats Handbook by Günter Born](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL8407869W/The_File_Formats_Handbook?edition=key%3A/books/OL9805911M#overview) was published in 1995, and documents 84 distinct format/format families from popular software of the time. Most of the formats are described in great detail, sufficient to parse the data out of those formats and so more than enough to help design binary format signatures.

One evening, I skimmed through the book to try and list all the file formats and extensions in the book, so the contents could be compared to and integrated with the other format information sources.  The book is not very consistent in how it declares which file extensions are used by each format. Sometimes it appears to be declared in the chapter title, sometimes it is assumed and not really explicitly stated, sometimes declared in a table, sometimes it is buried in the body text, and some are only listed in Appendix A. As such, there may be some mistakes in this data.

The data was mastered in [TFFH: File extensions from The File Formats Handbook (Günter Born) - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zudz1pZyOsEzfdGTbk3S4YqLJLCl2CyHn4E5ss2oqbQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0) (please add comments if you spot errors!)

That was downloaded in CSV format and added here as `tffh.csv`.
