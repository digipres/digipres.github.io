TFFH: File extensions from The File Formats Handbook (G端nter Born)
==================================================================

[The File Formats Handbook by G端nter Born](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL8407869W/The_File_Formats_Handbook?edition=key%3A/books/OL9805911M#overview) was published in 1995, and documents 84 distinct format/format families from popular software of the time. Most of the formats are described in great detail, sufficient to parse the data out of those formats and so more than enough to help design binary format signatures.

One evening, I skimmed through the book to try and list all the file formats and extensions in the book, so the contents could be compared to and integrated with the other format information sources.  The book is not very consistent in how it declares which file extensions are used by each format. Sometimes it appears to be declared in the chapter title, sometimes it is assumed and not really explicitly stated, sometimes declared in a table, sometimes it is buried in the body text, and some are only listed in Appendix A. As such, there may be some mistakes in this data.

The data was mastered in [TFFH: File extensions from The File Formats Handbook (G端nter Born) - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zudz1pZyOsEzfdGTbk3S4YqLJLCl2CyHn4E5ss2oqbQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0) (please add comments if you spot errors!)

That was downloaded in CSV format and added here as `tffh.csv`.

The File Formats Handbook by G端nter Born

"An indispensable resource for programmers, consultants, researchers, and students in the field of graphics and file formats"

Today, each applications program uses its own vendor-specific format to store data. Yet end-users demand that programs accept data files that may have been created by totally different and sometimes competing programs. Software developers in particular depend on the file format information of different applications programs to implement advanced import and export functions. Unfortunately, most of the information about file formats is confidential, not well-documented, or not available for public use.

The painful search for file format information is now over. The File Formats Handbook uncovers the file formats used by popular software products in the areas of databases, spreadsheets, word processing, graphics, sound and multimedia. It is unmatched by any other book in its depth and breadth of coverage and in its attention to detail.

Included are:

- Database and index files for dBASE and FoxPro
- Spreadsheet file formats for Lotus 1-2-3, Excel, DIF, SIF, SYLK
- Word processing file formats for WORD, WordPerfect, WordStar, AMI Pro, SGML, and Rich Text Format (RTF)

Graphics file formats: PCX, GEM, IMG, Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM), WordPerfect Graphics (WPG), Windows and OS/2 BMP, Windows MetaFile (WMF), GIF, TIFF, Amiga IFF, AutoCAD DXF, Dr. Halo, TARGA, PC Paint/Pictor, JPEG/JFIF, Sun Raster Format, Mac PICT, MAC Paint, Atari ST Graphics Format, Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), MicroGrafx (PIC, DRW, GRF), HP-GL/2, MS-Paint (MSP), and more

- Animation formats for Animator (FLI) and Video for Windows (AVI)
- Sound formats (WAV, VOC, MOD) and MIDI formats
- Windows formats (CLP, CRD, WRI, ICO, GRP)

The File Formats Handbook helps readers make their graphics programming instantly compatible with all major graphics applications. Readers also gain access to valid insider knowledge and have the opportunity to explore the secrets of file formats.
