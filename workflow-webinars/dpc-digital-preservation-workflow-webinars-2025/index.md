Free to attend and open to all, the Digital Preservation Workflow Webinar series will showcase just some of the digital preservation workflow processes developed and implemented by the digital preservation community. Each speaker will present their workflow, which represents a part of the digital preservation process or a particular digital media or content type, before we open the floor for discussion and a chance to ask questions.
