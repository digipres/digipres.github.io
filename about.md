Since [2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20141116023718/https://www.digipres.org/), DigiPres.org has sought to provide a community-owned 'homepage' for digital preservation.  Somewhere to start, somewhere to find answers to shared questions, somewhere to share links to the information resources we need to preserve digital collections.

DigiPres.org is community owned and run, so it needs your contributions to make it better. For more information, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](http://www.digipres.org/how_to_contribute_main.html)

Since the beginning, DigiPres.org has been kindly hosted by the [Open Preservation Foundation](https://openpreservation.org/) and supported by the [Digital Preservation Coalition](https://www.dpconline.org/). The initial implementation was made possible by the [Digital POWRR Project](https://digitalpowrr.niu.edu/) and the Northern Illinois University. Updates in 2024 and 2025 were funded by Yale University Library and the Digital Preservation Coalition through the [Registries of Good Practice project](https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/collaborative-projects/registries-of-good-practice).
