- The Digital Preservation Awesome List has a section on the communities in and around digital preservation: [Become part of the Digital Preservation Community](https://github.com/digipres/awesome-digital-preservation?tab=readme-ov-file#become-part-of-the-digital-preservation-community)
- [The nestor Community Profiles](https://www.langzeitarchivierung.de/Webs/nestor/EN/Services/nestor_Community_Profiles/nestor_Community_Profiles_node.html)  are compilations of data on individual communities in digital long-term archiving.
- [This shared Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UpOF5KZJgLZZOEtjCnDMk7-M9z4iyQ4Y0ud326TzpXg/edit?gid=0#gid=0) lists forums and channels related to the practice of digital preservation.

## Local & Regional Groups

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  This is an experimental addition to the site, and to keep things manageable, the current work has been scoped to the United Kingdom and Ireland. You can read <a href="https://github.com/digipres/digipres.github.io/pull/58" class="alert-link">this GitHub issue</a> to find out more about the status of this experiment.

This section lists local and regional [communities of practice](https://www.wenger-trayner.com/introduction-to-communities-of-practice/) dedicated to digital preservation. The idea is to help people find and start groups that are:

- Run by and for practitioners working in digital preservation and related fields.
- Local, in the sense that in-person meetings are possible for members that do not have access to funding to attend national and international conferences.
