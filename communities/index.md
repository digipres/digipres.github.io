## Lists of Digital Preservation Groups

As digital preservation is a shared concern across a lot of different fields and applications, there are lots of different groups out there. Here are some links to lists of related groups:

- The Digital Preservation Awesome List has a [section on the communities in and around digital preservation](https://github.com/digipres/awesome-digital-preservation?tab=readme-ov-file#become-part-of-the-digital-preservation-community).
- [The nestor Community Profiles](https://www.langzeitarchivierung.de/Webs/nestor/EN/Services/nestor_Community_Profiles/nestor_Community_Profiles_node.html)  are compilations of data on individual communities in digital long-term archiving.
- [This shared Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UpOF5KZJgLZZOEtjCnDMk7-M9z4iyQ4Y0ud326TzpXg/edit?gid=0#gid=0) lists forums and channels related to the practice of digital preservation.

## Local & Regional Groups

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  This is an experimental addition to the site, and to keep things manageable, the initial work has been scoped to a small set of groups. Other groups are welcome to add themselves (or ask me to add them) if they wish. You can read <a href="https://github.com/orgs/digipres/discussions/62" class="alert-link">this GitHub discussion</a> to find out more about the status of this experiment.

This is a list of local and regional [communities of practice](https://www.wenger-trayner.com/introduction-to-communities-of-practice/) dedicated to digital preservation can set up a simple public web page. The idea is to help people find groups:

- That are run by and for practitioners working in and around digital preservation.
- That are local, so that in-person meetings are possible for members that do not have access to funding to attend conferences.
- That speak a natural/native language they understand.

If your group isn't listed, please [open an issue to tell us about it](https://github.com/digipres/digipres.github.io/issues/new?template=local-group-template.md), or [add it directly youself (required a GitHub account)](/admin/#/collections/local-groups/new).

If there isn't already a group near you, you could consider [starting your own digital preservation community group](./start/).
